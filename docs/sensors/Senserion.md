## Connector

=== "5 pin"

    5 pin JST ZH (1.50mm pitch)

    | Pin | Name   | Voltage      | Function                       |
    | --- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
    | 1   | VDD    | 5V±10%       |
    | 2   | RX/SDA | 3.3V/5V TTL  | serial port/I2C                |
    | 3   | TX/SCL | 3.3V/5V TTL  | serial port/I2C                |
    | 4   | SEL    | floating/GND | floating for UART, GND for I2C |
    | 5   | GND    | 0V           |

## Protocol

Serial protocol is UART 115200 8N1 5V TTL :material-alert: 3.3V compatible.

=== "commands"

    !!! note
        The [SPS30] only support continuous operation, at about one measurement per second.
        However, new measurements are not streamed. Each measurement has to be requested.
        This behavior is consistent with `passive_mode`/single-shot operation in other sensors.

        The `sleep`/`wake` commands listed here (stop measurement/start measurement on the [datasheet][SPS30]),
        behave consistently with the rest of the supported PM sensors.
        There are also `deep-sleep`/`wake-up` commands (sleep/wake-up on the [datasheet][SPS30]),
        which are not implemented. As `deep-sleep` disable the UART interface and `wake-up` is a 2 stage procedure.

    | Command        | Description              | `message`                 |
    | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
    | `active_mode`  | continuous operation     | N/A                       |
    | `passive_mode` | single-shot operation    | N/A                       |
    | `passive_read` | request last measurement | `7E 00 03 00 FC 7E`       |
    | `sleep`        | idle mode                | `7E 00 01 00 FE 7E`       |
    | `wake`         | wake up from idle mode   | `7E 00 00 02 01 03 F9 7E` |

=== "message"

    Messages containing measurements consist of floats.
    The second to last bit of the message should contain `0xFF-sum(message[1:-2])%0x100`.

    | `message` | [SPS30]          |
    | --------- | ---------------- |
    |           | 47 bits          |
    | header    | 5 bits           |
    |           | `7E 00 03 00 28` |
    | body      | 40 bits          |
    |           | 10 values        |
    | checksum  | 1 bit            |
    | tail      | 1 bit            |
    |           | `7E`             |

=== "SPS30"

    The message body (`message[5:-2]`) contains 10 values:

    - pm01, pm25, pm04, pm10: PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10 [ug/m³]
    - n0_5, n1_0, n2_5, n4_0, n10_0: number concentrations under X.Y um [#/cm³]
    - diam: typical particle size [μm]

Read raw messages from 2 different sensors and store them on a sqlite DB.
After reading the sensor, decode all messages on DB and print them.

- PMSx003 senor on /dev/ttyUSB0
- MCU680 sensor on /dev/ttyUSB1
- read 4 samples for each sensor, by default
- read one sample from each sensor every 20 seconds, by default

NOTE:
When reading 2 or more sensors only the timing of the first sensor is guarantied.
In this example, the second sensor will be read right after the first sensor.

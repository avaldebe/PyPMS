"""
Read measurements from 2 different sensors and store them
on a sqlite DB as a "tall table" with a "wide table" view for each sensor.
After reading the sensor, get all measurements from the DB amd print them by sensor.

- PMSx003 senor on /dev/ttyUSB0
- MCU680 sensor on /dev/ttyUSB1
- read 4 samples for each sensor, by default
- read one sample from each sensor every 20 seconds, by default

NOTE:
the read_obs function creates a subclass of sensor.Data in order to avoid the
__post_init__ call, as this was already tone when the sensor message was decoded.
Please open an issue or submit a PR i you know of a cleaner way to achieve this.
